# Gorilla: Large Language Model for API Interactions

Gorilla is a Large Language Model (LLM) designed to revolutionize the way we interact with APIs. Developed by a team of researchers at UC Berkeley and Microsoft Research, Gorilla is trained on three massive machine learning hub datasets: Torch Hub, TensorFlow Hub, and HuggingFace. The team is also rapidly adding new domains, including Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, OpenAPI, and more.

## Features

- **API Interaction**: Gorilla provides appropriate API calls, making it a unique tool in the field of LLMs.
- **Performance**: In a zero-shot setting, Gorilla outperforms GPT-4, Chat-GPT, and Claude.
- **Reliability**: Gorilla is extremely reliable and significantly reduces hallucination errors, a common issue with other LLMs.

## Usage

Gorilla is designed to be user-friendly. You can try Gorilla in just 60 seconds without any sign-ups or installations, thanks to its integration with Google Colab.

## License

With Apache 2.0 licensed LLM models, you can use Gorilla commercially without any obligations.

## Contribution

We welcome your feedback and API contributions as we continue to build this open-source project.
